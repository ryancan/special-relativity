# special-relativity
this simulation is supposed to demonstrate time dialation relating to einstein's theory of special relativity. the goal is to have a train move across the screen with light(particle) bouncing up and down inside the train while it is moving. A button or event will activate the light to leave a trace of its path. the dialation of time will then be shown with the help of some assumptions, equations and pythagoras
